# RMIT UNIVERSITY
## BEng(AeroEng)

I started to study at RMIT University in 2024, studying for a Bachelor of Engineering (Aerospace Engineering).

To date (Feb 2026) I have completed 50% of my units of study. During my spare time in semester I tended to study technical things that lay within the general scope of broader engineering but not strictly within my discipline.

A current side "project" is learning C++ through the implementation of a HPC program (High Performance Compute) making use of OpenACC, OpenMP and MPI. I have been planning to incorporate a few engineering concepts into this program.
Alas, for the time being I have been studying about compute optimizations.
