# First Post

'Low a wild website appears!

I am starting this website/blog/repository, rather late. By now I am just six days away from starting my 3rd year at RMIT University, studying Aerospace Engineering.

This fifth semester I will be taking yet another four classes. Two related to aerospace structures, one related to Geodesy and one related to CFD.

I will later outline some more rules/guidelines on my posts on this site.

So to the future

- Signing off
