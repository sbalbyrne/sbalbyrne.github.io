# About Me! but I ramble... coherantly.

Irionic isn't it? That this entire website is about me, but I made an entire page for this?
Anyway...

I am Sebastiano, I am a very enthusiastic student of many realms and domains within the broader area of engineering. My goals are simple, I want to see the constant human nature of wanting to explore and expand, reach beyond the shores of our own pale blue dot and venture out into the stars.

Well, fanciful as it may be now to venture towards the stars, venturing to the neighboring planets and moons within our solar system is definitely doable, within this decade or two.

I am driven by not only by my passion and love for satellites and probes, the exploration of the beyond but also I am driven by my almost fervent desire to learn and apply my knowledge.

I may be a little eccentric in my mannerisms, stemming from a love of reading books as a kid (and slowly learning the very basics of bookbinding as a hobby), but even so, surrounding myself in an abundance of information is never daunting, but fascinating.

Over the last three years, I have managed to expand my knowledge both in class and my own terms in order to learn more, reading papers and reports of the early missions to seemingly close but distant planets (Venus, Jupiter and the Galilean Moons) has become easier, albeit still difficult to understand.

"Learning" so much comes at a steep price, I often forget these little scraps of information before I can find a way or a time to apply the knowledge gained. In this respect, I am still young, and have much to learn on such things.

Well, that's enough about my interests and such, more about my life!

I was born in Guatemala, lived in Brooklyn, New York in the United States of America until I moved over to Melbourne, Australia, where I have been for the last seven years.

Being the son of an Italian and Australian, I speak both Italian and English, and I consider many places to be home, places that I would gladly return to but even then I want to see more of the world.

It is truly a shame that the aerospace industry, mainly the space industry, in Australia, my current locale of home, is quite weak in many respects, but mainly what I want to do, which is satellite/spacecraft engineering. Fortunately for me, I have many countries "nearby" (because is anything really nearby to south-eastern Australia) like New Zealand, Japan and the USA, which have developing space industries.

So on and so forth though and as cliche' as it may be...

Per aspera ad astra :P
